It will explore the strategies employed by the U\u00ed Raghallaigh rulers to maintain their power and influence, their relationships with neighboring lordships such as the Meig Uidhir, U\u00ed Dhomhnaill, and U\u00ed Ruairc, and the ways in which their identity was shaped by their interactions with the increasing influence of the English in the eastern kingdom of the Pale.",
    "example_output": "* **Project details:**\nThis book will fill a significant gap in the current literature on medieval Ireland by providing a comprehensive study of one of the most important Gaelic lordships of the period. The book will consist of chapters that examine the following topics:\n\n    * The origins and early history of the U\u00ed Raghallaigh lordship in East Breifne\n    * The political and military strategies of the U\u00ed Raghallaigh\n    * The territorial expansion and consolidation of the lordship, especially in territorial disputes\n    * The cultural and religious life of the U\u00ed Raghallaigh territory, their connection with St Maed\u00f3c and the foundation of churches\n    * The impact of the Anglo-Norman invasion on the U\u00ed Raghallaigh lordship and their later rapid Anglicisation\n\n* **Context:**\nThis book is intended for both academic and non-academic audiences interested in medieval Ireland, Gaelic history, and the history of power and identity. It will be of particular interest to scholars of medieval history, Irish studies, and political science. The book will draw on recent publications in these fields, such as those by Katharine Simms (The O'Reillys and the kingdom of East Breifne), Raymond Gillespie, and Marie Therese Flanagan, to provide a fresh and up-to-date perspective on the U\u00ed Raghallaigh lordship.",
